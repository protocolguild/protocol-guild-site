## TLDR

- Ethereum’s core protocol work doubled down on scaling the L1, scaling L2s, and improving Ethereum UX in 2025. In addition to celebrating Ethereum’s 10 year anniversary with no downtime, two upgrades (Pectra and Fusaka) were shipped in 2025, helping to boost the gas limit from 30m to 60m, while target blobs were increased from 3 to 10. Alongside those scaling improvements, numerous UX improvements were implemented including smart account capabilities for externally owned accounts (EOAs) as well as stake consolidations for validators.
- All-time funding inflows reached $183m in 2025 (valued at time of donation), with $7.2m in new donations throughout the year. The top 5 donors for the year included Puffer, Starknet, Optimism RPGF, Enter DAO and LayerZero.
- Funding outflows, i.e. distributions of vested donations to Ethereum’s core protocol maintainers, totalled $12.4mm in 2025, an increase from the $10m distributed in 2024. Overall, the median amount distributed over the last 12 months totalled $62k per member.
- A new funding program was announced in 2025: “Sponsor a Core Dev”. Intended to complement the 1% Pledge, it is designed to connect donors more directly with core devs, while unlocking a more flexible donation path for teams that are post-TGE.
- 2025 saw the arrival of a new brand identity for Protocol Guild, including a standalone website! On the content side the year was highlighted by our first-ever core developer compensation report, as well as numerous other blog posts, conference talks, podcasts and social media posts.
- Protocol Guild’s governance got an upgrade with the Agora DAO migration, enabling control of funding distribution contracts to be transferred from a multisig to the DAO.

## Introduction

Protocol Guild is the leading independent funding organization for Ethereum core developers. We proactively fund maintainers doing work the ecosystem depends on. Our mission is to secure Ethereum’s future by funding core contributors.

This report follows our [2024 annual report](https://www.protocolguild.org/blog/20250205-annual-report-2024), and was prepared by Protocol Guild’s  operations team, which helps manage and grow the organization. The report summarizes all of Protocol Guild’s achievements in 2025, as well as a snapshot of the advancements made to Ethereum’s core protocol during that time.

## Donor Acknowledgement

Protocol Guild is only possible thanks to the generous support of our ecosystem: projects, communities, and individuals that have chosen to fund the foundational public good that is Ethereum’s core protocol work.

Projects that have pledged to donate 1% of their token supply - i.e. [the Protocol Guild Pledge](https://www.protocolguild.org/blog/20240130-protocol-guild-pledge) - account for roughly 83% of PG’s total funding to date. In honor of their significant contributions, here they all are in in chronological order:

Thank you to everyone who contributed time, credibility, attention, or capital to sustaining Ethereum’s core protocol work in 2025.

## Core Protocol Development Updates

The Ethereum protocol celebrated its 10 year anniversary in 2025, and a big theme of that anniversary was “10 years, no downtime”. This unrivaled track record of uptime is a testament to the incredible work being done by Ethereum’s core protocol contributors, considering the scale of the coordination required for these upgrades, as well as the amount of funds that are being secured by Ethereum. In addition to this incredible milestone, 2025 also saw two major upgrades shipped to mainnet.

### Pectra

In May 2025, the first upgrade of the year went live with [Pectra](https://forkcast.org/upgrade/pectra) - the biggest upgrade in Ethereum’s history - bringing many improvements to the core protocol (see the list at [EIP-7600](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7600)). Key user experience enhancements included adding programmability to Ethereum’s default accounts (EOAs or externally-owned accounts) via EIP-7702. This upgrade gave all EOAs account abstraction powers, including batching and gas-free transactions. Pectra also introduced improvements to the staking UI, including stake consolidation and increased balance caps (EIP 7251), as well as faster deposits (EIP 6110). Finally, scaling-related enhancements on the L2 side included doubling the target number of blobs (EIP 7691).

### Fusaka

While Pectra was in the final stages of being released,  core developers were already preparing to ship the second upgrade of the year, [Fusaka](https://forkcast.org/upgrade/fusaka), which landed in December (learn more at  [EIP-7607](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7607)). It should be noted that two upgrades in one year of this scale and complexity are unprecedented for Ethereum’s core protocol development - an excellent reminder of the incredible amount of work that goes into these upgrades! The headliner of the Fusaka upgrade was PeerDAS, which optimized the data availability layer used by Ethereum’s L2s. PeerDAS essentially fulfilled Ethereum’s vision of “sharding”, by allowing mainnet nodes to store a fraction of ”blob” data - the unit of account for L2 data availability - while still enabling that data to be fully reproducible across all nodes. This change enabled immediate increases in bandwidth, and set a foundation for  additional future increases. Fusaka also enhanced L1 scalability by increasing the block gas limit from 45m to 60m. Finally, user experience improvements such as native passkey and secp256r1 support (EIP-7951) rounded out the upgrade.

### Glamsterdam

Parallel to the upgrades that were shipped in 2025, work was already underway on the next upgrade planned for 2026: [Glamsterdam](https://forkcast.org/upgrade/glamsterdam). Its headliners include enshrined proposer-builder separation aka ePBS (EIP-7732), which will enable significant L1 scalability increases by optimizing the block production pipeline, as well as block level access lists aka BALs (EIP-7928) which also supports significant L1 scalability unlocks by introducing parallelization to execution clients.

Here’s to another 10 years with no downtime!

_It’s important to note that not all core protocol maintainers are members of Protocol Guild; Ethereum stewardship comes from a broader community. Still, Protocol Guild  represents a meaningful snapshot of the cohort doing critical, long-horizon protocol work._

## Membership Curation

Protocol Guild is defined by its membership registry of Ethereum’s core protocol contributors. Since being launched in 2022, Protocol Guild has audited this membership registry on a quarterly basis to ensure the list only includes active contributors. As part of this membership curation, Protocol Guild also saw iterative refinement to its eligibility framework and [documentation](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/) throughout the year.

### Membership Changes

Protocol Guild started 2025 with 186 members, but ended with 184. This resulted through the addition of 43 members and removal of 45 members throughout the year. This is the first year that Protocol Guild’s membership has decreased since its inception, but we expect the number of members to be relatively stable around this level heading into 2026.

[https://dune.com/queries/2665887/4430654](https://dune.com/queries/2665887/4430654)

### Notable Updates

- Protocol Guild hosted many in-person meetings with members at the [**Berlinterop**](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/06/19/checkpoint-4) in June, discussing a range of topics including introducing impact weighting, as well as capping team weights and the number of client slots.
- The ops team invested substantial effort into exploring different funding distribution methods other than the current “[time weighting](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01-membership.html#time-weight)” mechanism. Multiple drafts were explored, culminating in a **team impact ranking** draft proposal focused on output and performance over pure tenure/time-weighting.
- Q3 saw a significant [refactor](https://github.com/protocolguild/documentation/pull/362) to Protocol Guild’s documentation's eligibility and membership pages, to provide a clearer overview of contributors and their work. This also included the formalization of working groups, to provide clearer coordination surfaces for specialized workstreams.
- A proposal to add a **zkEVM Working Group** was [merged](https://github.com/protocolguild/documentation/pull/400) in Q4, following [earlier discussion](https://github.com/protocolguild/documentation/pull/372) around zkEVM/snarkification eligibility.
- Throughout the year the ops team hosted 24 membership calls, added a [section in the docs](https://github.com/protocolguild/documentation/blob/main/docs/01-membership.md#alumni-members) for former/alumni members, and created an alumni Discord channel to build a network of Ethereum’s core protocol contributors.

## Fundraising

2025 fundraising was mixed: we were unfortunately not able to match the unbelievable funding highs achieved in 2024, however due to Protocol Guild’s 4-year vesting mechanism, Protocol Guild members still received more funds YoY. 

Protocol Guild raised $7.2mm in 2025 from a total of 6,202 unique donors. During that same time, a total of $12.4mm in funding was vested and distributed to Protocol Guild members, representing approximately $62k per member.

[https://dune.com/queries/6481124/10267324](https://dune.com/queries/6481124/10267324)

Protocol Guild was honored to welcome five new 1% pledges in 2026, from [INTMAX](https://x.com/intmaxIO/status/1880233654036901994?s=20), [Shape](https://x.com/ProtocolGuild/status/1904629406536188339?s=20), [Yodl](https://x.com/yodlpay/status/1963225504586309760), [CurrencyCoin](https://x.com/ProtocolGuild/status/1975662271499219118) and [Ascend](https://www.protocolguild.org/blog/20251217-ascend-protocol-takes-the-1-percent-pledge).

The largest donation of the year came from a 2024 pledge alumni, [Puffer](https://x.com/puffer_finance/status/1844234772274729416), totalling just over $4m.The largest non-pledge donation came from Starknet, whose donation totalled $1.5mm. Rounding out 2025’s  top 5 donor leaderboard was Optimism, Enter DAO and LayerZero. The funds from Optimism came from 2024’s [Retro Funding 5 “OP Stack”](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-op-stack-round-details/8612), while the funds from Enter DAO were unclaimed funds after [winding up of the DAO](https://medium.com/enterdao/a-next-step-for-enterdao-2b8714bc0122), while funds from LayerZero represented the continuation of their [2024 TGE campaign](https://x.com/LayerZero_Fndn/status/1803742303204323494), where a donation to Protocol Guild was required to claim their airdrop. 

Protocol Guild was fortunate to also receive support from tradfi in 2025, in the form of a [$100k donation](https://x.com/AK_EtherMachine/status/1950627149066461281?s=20) from the Ether Machine’s Andrew Keys, $50k from [Bitwise](https://x.com/BitwiseInvest/status/1892227696853385636) and $25k from [Van Eck](https://x.com/ProtocolGuild/status/1890472762927440216). 

| # | 1%? | Donor | Value at Inflow |

Despite continued buy-in from Ethereum’s ecosystem to fund Ethereum’s core protocol work, we unfortunately did not hit our goal of boosting the “median annual funding per member” to $300k by the end of 2025. As described in our [2024 annual report](https://www.protocolguild.org/blog/20250205-annual-report-2024), “achieving this goal would enable members to rely on Protocol Guild as their sole source of income if they choose.” Instead, that number totaled $62k per member at the end of 2025, a reflection of highly volatile market conditions in 2025. 

This miss reinforced the need for diversified funding rails beyond the 1% pledge and ad-hoc donations, which informed the launch of a new funding program: “[Sponsor a Core Dev](https://www.protocolguild.org/blog/20251218-sponsor-core-devs)”. Anchored on filling the [$160k annual compensation gap](https://www.protocolguild.org/blog/20250909-compensation-insights-for-ethereum-core-developers-2025) per Protocol Guild member, this new funding primitive is designed to better serve teams that are post-TGE or who don’t want to participate in token-pledge mechanics. The 1% Pledge remains Protocol Guild’s primary fundraising focus, however sponsorships will hopefully provide more consistent funding in between larger pledges, due to the smaller commitment required. We look forward to announcing our “Sponsor a Core Dev” pilot cohort later in Q1 ‘26.

## Marketing

2025 was Protocol Guild’s strongest marketing year to date, in terms of consistency and surface area:

- Rebrand including new logo and [website](https://www.protocolguild.org/)

![Website](/20260129-annual-report-2025/Website.png)

- We published the first “[Core Dev Compensation Report](https://www.protocolguild.org/blog/20250909-compensation-insights-for-ethereum-core-developers-2025)”, a quantitative compensation gap analysis, which became a foundational marketing + fundraising asset, as well as shared reference point for “why Protocol Guild matters.” Major takeaways include:
  - High Demand: Nearly 40% of contributors received final offers from outside employment opportunities in the past year
  - Massive Pay Gap: Current fiat compensation (salary + bonus) is 50-60% below market offers
  - No Upside Exposure: The median contributor earns $0 in equity/tokens as part of their regular employment
  - Critical Lifeline: Protocol Guild funding made up almost 1/3 of the total compensation package for core contributors over the past year
  - Retention Boon: Protocol Guild funding is rated as "very/extremely important" by 59% of members to support their ongoing work

## Smart Contract Architecture

Protocol Guild’s onchain smart contract architecture received significant overhauls in 2026, with the adoption of Splitv2.1 contracts to help streamline onchain funding flows, the expansion of funding contracts onto new L2s, as well as the deployment of a new [Agora DAO](https://www.agora.xyz/) for the membership to control the Splitv2.1 contracts.

![Architecture](/20260129-annual-report-2025/Architecture.png)

To quickly recap, Protocol Guild’s donation address is an [immutable vesting contract](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0x25941dc771bb64514fc8abbce970307fb9d477e9/) which vests tokens linearily over 4 years. Vested funds get pushed into a [Pass-Through Wallet](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0x25941dc771bb64514fc8abbce970307fb9d477e9/) (PTW), before being pushed to a [Split contract](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0xd982477216dadd4c258094b071b49d17b6271d66/?chainId=1) for distribution to Protocol Guild Members. The Split contract is mutable, as it is updated every quarter with Protocol Guild’s up-to-date membership. The PTW is also mutable, to enable us to swap out Split contracts when needed (since the vesting contracts recipient cannot be changed.) All these contracts are all built and maintained by the incredibly talented [Splits team](https://splits.org/).

In 2025 the Splits team released an upgraded version of their Split contract, [Splitv2.1](https://docs.splits.org/core/split-v2), which Protocol Guild adopted on Ethereum mainnet, as well as [Arbitrum](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0xd982477216dadd4c258094b071b49d17b6271d66/?chainId=42161), [Base](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0xd982477216dadd4c258094b071b49d17b6271d66/?chainId=8453) and [Optimism](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0xd982477216dadd4c258094b071b49d17b6271d66/?chainId=10). Alongside this, new vesting contracts were also deployed on [Arbitrum](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0x7F8DCFd764bA8e9B3BA577dC641D5c664B74c47b/?chainId=42161), [Base](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0xd16713A5D4Eb7E3aAc9D2228eB72f6f7328FADBD/?chainId=8453) and [Optimism](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0x58ae0925077527a87D3B785aDecA018F9977Ec34/?chainId=10) for the first time.

In the past, these Split contracts were controlled by Protocol Guild’s [6/10 multisigs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02-onchain-architecture.html#multisigs). However, with the launch of [Protocol Guild’s new Agora DAO,](http://gov.protocolguild.org/) this control has been migrated directly to the DAO. Huge thanks to the [Agora team](https://www.agora.xyz/) for enabling a smooth transition from our [Moloch V3 DAO](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0x1/0x412a32dd71357bd12337f4408168df903f90cbd3/proposals). Reducing multisig dependencies was a key goal for 2025, and we are pleased to have made big strides in that regard.

## Legal Entity

Protocol Guild incorporated a legal entity in 2024 to help scale fundraising efforts, with the entity receiving a portion of vested funds to cover operating expenses, including contributor payments, legal fees and director’s insurance. Since September 2024, Protocol Guild’s legal entity has received 5% of vested funds. 

For transparency, we are sharing the legal entity's financials for 2025 below.

## 2026 Plans

Fundraising conditions remained challenging and several major closes slipped into 2026, but the core strategy is clearer than ever: broaden the number of “ways to say yes” to funding Ethereum’s essential dependencies, and continue upgrading our operational credibility so the ecosystem can trust it at scale.

One point that must be communicated, is that the largest source underwriting Ethereum’s value is the continuation of core development and that, simultaneously, this process remains currently underfunded by a significant margin. Core contributors are earning 50-60% below cash compensation offers outside of core development, with an even wider margin in risk compensation. While the popular refrain from the ecosystem alludes to a reliance on entities like the Ethereum Foundation for perpetual funding, [looming budget constraints](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/06/04/ef-treasury-policy?) prove this is not a sustainable strategy.

Since Protocol Guild’s 2022 inception, it has processed inflows worth hundreds of millions of dollars and distributed over $36 million to the individuals delivering Ethereum core development outcomes. Through a combination of value sources (yield, tokens, revenue, excess funds), the ecosystem **must** come together to recognize this critical constraint and proactively seek solutions to create a sustainable funding paradigm. Protocol Guild is a tried-and-true mechanism for routing that funding to the ecosystem’s most critical actors. With focus and buy-in, 2026 can become a crucial turning point in establishing enduring funding streams for this work.

With this in mind, our priorities going into 2026 are;

1. Continue to build norms around projects taking the 1% pledge
2. Increase fundraising consistency via a multi-modal approach:
   - Close more frequent sponsorships to build a dependable floor
   - Pursue new in-app funding models with major projects
   - Deputize external fundraising contributors via commission-like program
   - Collaborate with other partners to develop differentiated and meaningful inflows
3. Continue to iterate on alternative weighting proposals with membership (impact or otherwise)

## Conclusion

2025 was a year of meaningful institutional progress for Protocol Guild. We decentralized core operational control to the DAO, strengthened membership and working group structures, improved our legitimacy path through impact-weighting work and expanded our fundraising toolkit with the Sponsor a Core Dev vehicle.

These are the kinds of “plumbing upgrades” that are mostly invisible in the short term, but fundamental to sustaining Ethereum’s contributor base through the next major roadmap arcs.

On that note, thank you to everyone supporting Protocol Guild. Ethereum’s durability depends on the people who maintain it, while those people depend on the ecosystem choosing to fund what it relies on.

In [last year’s annual report](https://www.protocolguild.org/blog/20250205-annual-report-2024) we included the address of every single unique donor, but given the huge volume of donations this year, we won’t be able to repeat that. Instead, here is a list of the [top 500 donors from 2025](https://dune.com/queries/6596941/10415079) (ordered by value at time of donation).
