Summary
-------

Core developers pass up at least 50% of their market value to maintain crucial ecosystem software. Protocol Guild facilitates significant funding to help reduce this gap and retain talent long term.

This report examines compensation data from a majority of Ethereum's core protocol contributors across 13 different orgs, revealing significant gaps between their current compensation and potential market earnings. While many members prioritize working on values-aligned projects, inadequate compensation is a risk to talent retention, the progress of Ethereum's technical roadmap, and long-term credible neutrality. As the leading independent funder of core development, Protocol Guild plays an increasingly important role in addressing this challenge - but there's still significant work to be done. Ecosystem funding entities should understand this as a serious challenge and focus on finding scalable solutions to close the compensation gap.

Takeaways:

1.  High Demand: Nearly 40% of contributors received final offers from outside employment opportunities in the past year

2.  Massive Pay Gap: Current fiat compensation (salary + bonus) is 50-60% below market offers

3.  No Upside Exposure: The median contributor earns $0 in equity/tokens as part of their regular employment

4.  Critical Lifeline: Protocol Guild funding made up almost 1/3 of the total compensation package for core contributors over the past year

5.  Retention Boon: Protocol Guild funding is rated as "very/extremely important" by 59% of members to support their ongoing work

Introduction
============

Ethereum core development is the ongoing process of enhancing and evolving the underlying software and protocol that power the Ethereum blockchain. A diverse set of stakeholders deliver improvements to scalability, security, and functionality through research, design, and implementation of EIPs.

This report was produced by [Protocol Guild](http://www.protocolguild.org), the leading independent funding organization for ~190 Ethereum core developers. The organization enables the ecosystem to directly fund all the individuals building our shared infrastructure - largely through a norm called the 1% Pledge. In a strategic and generous gesture, projects like EigenLayer, Ether.fi, Taiko, Puffer and others have contributed 1% of their token supply. Read more about the 1% Pledge [here](https://www.protocolguild.org/blog/20240130--protocol-guild-pledge).

Since Pilot launch in May 2022, Protocol Guild has distributed over $32mm of funding directly to Ethereum's core protocol contributors. The median member has received $66k over the last 12 months. Any funding sent by the ecosystem vests onchain over 4 years: these realtime, transparent distributions can be tracked via [this Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/protocolguild/protocol-guild). Protocol Guild does not employ these core protocol contributors. The direct funding they receive today is a supplement on top of their regular employment, focused on addressing the lack of risk (token and/or equity) compensation they might typically receive in a different role. The commercial entities which are the employers and fiscal hosts of core devs typically do not have direct ways to monetize this software work. Instead, they manifest as cost centers in large orgs, sometimes are used as in-house expertise for their own blockchain ventures, or have adjacent services built around them (eg. security, consulting, auditing, chain-specific releases), or scrape by on minimal grants funding.

In Q2 2025, Protocol Guild surveyed its membership to understand compensation levels, offer dynamics, and how the supplied funding facilitates talent retention. Anecdotally, it has been long known that these individuals were underpaid relative to market benchmarks. This has a number of downstream effects:

-   Limits Ethereum's ability to compete for talent. Does not expose our talent pool to the maximum range of available talent.

-   Increases churn, weakens the Ethereum political economy and makes the institutional memory less robust

-   Potentially makes client teams more likely to be acquired by larger entities

-   In the extreme, makes the Ethereum upgrade delivery process slower

-   In the extreme, may make core devs more susceptible to payments for influence or soft influence

This survey quantifies that undercompensation and explores how Protocol Guild helps close it, both now and in the future. With 111 responses from 190 total Protocol Guild members (a 58% response rate), this is the most comprehensive compensation analysis of Ethereum core development talent to date. It should be noted that there will be outliers or exceptions to this report within broader Ethereum core development (eg. in total ~200 to 300 contributors with roles that sometimes overlap but are typically broader than the core protocol) not adequately represented by the data here.

Please refer to the Appendices at the end of the report for methodology/survey questions, limitations and recognition for the incredible donors which have made Protocol Guild possible.

Current Compensation
--------------------

### Current compensation refers to the aggregate funding that core contributors currently receive via their employer and Protocol Guild. This measure considers the last 12 months, including breakdowns for compensation types: cash (salary and bonus denominated in fiat) and risk (tokens and/or liquid equity).

### Cash Compensation

The foundation of any compensation package is base salary, as well as bonuses, denominated in fiat - referred to in this report as "cash". Respondents were asked to report their cash compensation. Note: there may be some outliers towards the bottom of the chart because Protocol Guild has part-time and full-time members who may have answered the survey differently.

-   Average: $157,939

-   Median: $140,000

2.1 Cash Compensation vs. Years of Experience (Total)

![](/Figure 2.1 - Current Cash vs. YoE.png)

2.2 Cash Compensation by Years of Experience ($)

-   1-2 Years: $135,000 median

-   3-4 Years: $120,000 median

-   5-6 Years: $160,000 median

-   7-8 Years: $212,000 median

-   9+ Years: $150,000 median

-   Client Development: $130,000 median

-   Research: $215,000 median

-   Coordination: $130,000 median

![](/Figure 2.3 - Current Cash by Role.png)

### Token & Equity Compensation

One of the most interesting findings is the absence of meaningful risk (equity & token) upside for most core developer respondents:

-   Only 37% receive any equity or token grants from their current employers

-   Equity compensation 

-   Median, across all respondents: $0

-   Average, for those that do receive: $19,000 annually

Due to the nature of their organization or business structure, employers of client teams are often not in the position to offer attractive, liquid equity or token packages with high potential upside. 

This stands in stark contrast to the broader crypto industry, where equity or token allocations are standard and often substantial - see this [2023 Dragonfly compensation report](https://dccr23.dragonfly.xyz/#1c7af13b64418125951efdff0b14b3f4). To get a sense of where risk compensation falls among comparable opportunities, see average token or equity grants from the Dragonfly report (percent denominated), and Coinbase compensation breakdown (dollar denominated).

### Protocol Guild: A Critical Bridge

Over the last three years, Protocol Guild has demonstrated its ability to provide the risk portion of employment packages and allow core developers to participate in some of the broader ecosystem's upside. When combined with survey data on employer compensation, data from [Dune](https://dune.com/protocolguild/protocol-guild) shows that Protocol Guild distributions have become a substantial portion of total core contributor compensation.

-   Average PG member distribution (Last 12 Months): $74,285

-   Median PG member distribution (Last 12 Months): $67,121

-   Cumulative Distributions since 2022: $32mm

-   Impact: PG represents nearly 1/3 of total compensation for the median member

Through inflows attributed to 1% Protocol Guild Pledge Partners, PG has emerged as a leading funder of Ethereum core developers. [Read more about the 1% pledge](https://tim.mirror.xyz/srVdVopOFhD_ZoRDR50x8n5wmW3aRJIrNEAkpyQ4_ng).

Total Compensation Picture:

-   With employer only: $140,000 median

-   Including Protocol Guild: $207,121 median (+48%)

Market Realities: What Developers Could Earn
--------------------------------------------

### The Offer Landscape

The competitive talent market for Ethereum developers is very active:

-   38% of members received and explored job offers in the past 12 months

-   108 total offers across 42 respondents

-   Primary competition from Layer 2s and other Layer 1s. Please note that this data only includes those who received final offers. Those who did not explore offer opportunities and explorations that did not reach the final offer stage are not reflected in the dataset.

Qualitative responses from the survey give us insight into how Protocol Guild members weight their mission against higher pay:

-   "I received an offer of 700,000 USD/year total compensation. However, I did not even start the process because I (right now) prefer to work in ETH L1 with a lower compensation." 

-   "I don't want any other job at the moment... It's more of the project rather than receiving more money."

-   "If I weren't in PG, I would more seriously consider offered positions. Despite PG income not being significant today, I'm optimistic that in the future it can close the gap enough to not feel I'm making a big compromise."

-   "I haven't actively explored job opportunities because I love my job. But I do feel very underpaid. Especially considering inflation and cost of living, my salary hasn't been adjusted for that."

### Offer Types by Category

This can potentially be interpreted a few ways:

-   Contributors with less tenure/pay are more likely to explore other opportunities

-   Contributors with less tenure/pay are more likely to be headhunted by recruiters

### Offer Token/Equity Compensation Analysis

While most current core developer employers don't offer significant risk compensation in the form of tokens or equity, the broader market does. From a respondent:

"Majority of startups/bigger companies offer equity. PG is the equivalent of that for eth core devs so it is very important to continue improving it so it can better match equity packages across the software engineering industry as a whole."

One of the key differentiators of crypto compensation is that, due to the nature of onchain capital formation, workers can experience liquidity events for early-stage token and equity holdings tied to projects they contribute to at a rate that is significantly higher than public markets, pulling total compensation to the upside.

The median respondent reported a 6.5% token and/or equity grant. It should be heavily caveated that this answer drew a small number of total responses (10). These offers came in at two distinct levels: cofounder level (10%-30%, possible heavy further dilution, 5 respondents) and early employee level (0.1%-3.0%, less likely to be diluted, 5 respondents). The latter aligns with the ranges reported in Dragonfly's compensation report.

-   Median equity grant offered: 6.5%

-   Primary sources: commercial entities developing L1s and L2 protocols

-   Represents substantial potential upside beyond cash compensation

The Compensation Gap: Quantifying Opportunity Cost
--------------------------------------------------

### Cash Compensation Gap

The Cash Compensation Gap refers to the figures derived by subtracting the levels of current compensation (Ccur) from the level of competing offers (Coff) then dividing the difference by the level of current compensation (Ccur). This gap illustrates the financial opportunity cost core devs face by working on Ethereum.

Coff - CcurCcur

Where:

-   Coff = competing offer fiat compensation

-   Ccur = current fiat compensation

For All Members:

-   Current median: $140,000

-   Offer median: $300,000

-   Gap: $160,000 (114%)

Translation: Ethereum core developers are earning roughly half of the cash compensation available to them via recruitment offers.

Cash Compensation Gap by Specialization ($)

![](/Figure 4.2 - Cash Gap by Role.png)

### Token & Equity Gap

Beyond cash, there's a massive gap in upside participation:

-   Current token & equity exposure: $0 median (outside Protocol Guild)

-   Protocol Guild: $67,121 median

-   Market equity offers: 6.5% median grant -- this represents potentially millions in upside for successful protocols

Total Compensation Gap

-   Cash Compensation Gap: $160,000 median

-   Token/Equity Gap: $67,121 median token/equity compensation via employer and Protocol Guild vs. 6.5% median token and/or equity grant

Conclusion
----------

This report illustrates the critical funding challenges for Ethereum core development. In-demand skillsets and local knowledge coupled with a lack of sufficiently scaled, sustainable funding creates significant financial pressures from higher market compensation offers.

### Protocol Guild Impact

Protocol Guild has emerged as a critical piece of economic infrastructure for Ethereum (already funding nearly â…“ of the total compensation for the median member) that:

-   Introduces some predictability through delayed release of a 4 yr vest funding mechanism

-   Aligns core developer incentives with the Ethereum ecosystem's long-term success

-   Creates equity-like upside today without needing traditional corporate structures (and potentially stable comp in the future)

-   Demonstrates ecosystem commitment to core development

By continuing to enact the norm of 1% Protocol Guild pledges, as projects like EigenLayer, Ether.Fi, Taiko & others have, the ecosystem can collectively ensure the foundation it is building upon maintains stability and continues to thrive.

An Emerging Economic Polity\
Ethereum's success has created unprecedented opportunities in the broader crypto ecosystem: 

-   Nearly [$1 Trillion](https://ultrasound.money/) in value secured by Ethereum

-   [Millions of users](https://www.growthepie.com/fundamentals/daily-active-addresses) expressing digital property rights

-   [Thousands of protocols and applications](https://defillama.com/chain/ethereum) depending on core protocol improvements

-   [Global financial infrastructure](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/02/ethereum-turns-10-from-scrappy-experiment-to-wall-streets-invisible-backbone.html) being built on Ethereum rails

Ethereum has been described by many metaphors - world computer, infinite garden, and [neutral ocean infra](https://x.com/trent_vanepps/status/1483266014087417856). A recent report from Fidelity introduced the frame of "[emerging economy](https://x.com/trent_vanepps/status/1483266014087417856)". As the ecosystem continues to mature, are we adequately investing in infrastructure and defense funding? Perhaps we should target the [Singaporean compensation model](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/2000063010.htm), where salaries for public servants are anchored to private market rates to attract and retain the best.

With all of the value that has been created on top of Ethereum and the [outsized role these open source developers play](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/24-038_51f8444f-502c-4139-8bf2-56eb4b65c58a.pdf), the cost of losing core talent could far exceed the funding required to develop and retain it. Supporting Ethereum core development is ultimately an investment in the entire ecosystem. These pressures will likely grow as the breadth of opportunities and depth of capital interests continue to increase. Protocol Guild has emerged as a critical stopgap solution, but will it be able to scale the norms and opt-in support from the broader ecosystem?

Ecosystem funding entities should keep in mind the magnitude and urgency of this funding gap. This isn't something that can be accomplished by any single entity (eg. the Ethereum Foundation), but instead requires the entire ecosystem to coalesce around the means and mechanisms capable of tackling this problem at scale.

For Ethereum to sustainably deliver its long-term roadmap, we must address compensation disparities for these invaluable, foundational contributors. Core contributors should be funded proportional to market value (if not their impact) - otherwise we risk our next decade.
