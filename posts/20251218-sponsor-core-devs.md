Protocol Guild is excited to launch the **Sponsor a Core Dev** funding program. This is a new funding vehicle designed to:

-   connect sponsor funding more directly with core devs

-   implement clearer success metrics for covering specific funding gaps

-   supplement the meaningful funding facilitated through our first program, the 1% Pledge 

-   represent and celebrate a broader set of ecosystem contributions

### The Challenge: A Critical Funding Gap for Crucial Work

The long-term health and security of our shared Ethereum infrastructure depends on the dedicated individuals who maintain it. Our recent report brought a critical issue to light: Ethereum's **core developers are undercompensated by 50-60%** compared to their market value. This makes us more at risk of losing essential talent, while failing to attract the next generation.

Read the report →[  Compensation Insights for Ethereum Core Developers](https://www.protocolguild.org/blog/20250909-compensation-insights-for-ethereum-core-developers-2025)

The data from the report is clear. With a median salary of $140,000 against market offers of $300,000, the median core developer faces a **$160,000 annual compensation gap.** Here's the data arranged by years of experience:

While protocol contributors are often values-motivated, we cannot rely on that alone to retain the top-tier talent necessary to advance the protocol and steward it for the decades to come. This work includes:

-   maintaining and developing one of the 12 different execution and consensus clients: critical for maintaining Ethereum's 100% uptime

-   testing and security of any new protocol features: scaling the L1, scaling L2 data availability, and improving interop

-   researching future constructions: post-quantum security, faster finality, zkEVMs

### How "Sponsor a Core Dev" Works

To support this crucial work, we are introducing annual sponsorships at the scale of the individual contributor. It's a direct, transparent, and impactful way for the entire ecosystem to support its own foundation.

This initiative makes supporting core development personal. Here's how you can get involved:

-   **Covering the gap:** the sponsorship tiers are anchored to the comp gap: **$160k in tokens, ETH, or stables.** We will periodically update this number with each annual compensation survey, to ensure it stays in line with general industry comp trends.

-   **Who it goes to:** contributions in this vehicle will vest over 1 year to our rigorously curated pool of core contributors - we audit our member beneficiaries every quarter
    -   Please note: While the “Sponsor a Core Dev” vehicle is denominated based on the individual funding gap, all funding vests to the entirety of membership

### How you can help: Become a Sponsor

Corporations, DAOs and individuals are invited to participate, directly covering the compensation gap and making a powerful statement of support for shared software resources.

For projects that intend to introduce a protocol token, the 1% Pledge is still the best option. 

| Core devs Funded Annually | $ amount |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $160k (covers funding gap for 1 member) |
| 2 | $320k |
| 4 | $640k |
| 1 team / 8 core devs | $1.28mm |

### Benefits for Sponsors

1.  **Invest in Shared Infrastructure:** Directly support the security and scalability of the network your project relies on.

2.  **Gain Public Recognition:** Be featured on our forthcoming donor page update, our[  public leaderboards](https://dune.com/protocolguild/protocol-guild), and in dedicated social announcements which showcase your project's commitment to the ecosystem. This provides the community with a clear view of the program's impact. We believe that transparency is essential for building trust and ensuring the long-term success of this initiative.

3.  **Attract Talent:** Signal to the Ethereum developer community that your project values and supports foundational open-source work: a core norm of the broader community.

### Get Involved Today

This new program expands on this success by providing a new, accessible entry point for community support.

We are currently gathering an initial cohort of funding partners to announce the program more formally in early 2026. If you or your organization are interested, please reach out to the team at hello@protocolguild.org or directly to one of the team members: Trent, Peter, or Cheeky.

Let's work together to ensure the brightest minds can continue to build the world computer! 🌐💻
