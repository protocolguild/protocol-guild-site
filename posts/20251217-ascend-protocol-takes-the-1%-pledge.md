Protocol Guild is honored to welcome Ascend Protocol as the newest project to commit to the PG 1% pledge, a growing norm that routes a portion of the Ascend network value directly to the people who are scaling and securing Ethereum. Ascend will contribute 1% of the total PEAK token supply, which will vest over 4 years to 185 core contributors. Their commitment supports the individuals responsible for upgrades like Fusaka through client implementation, research, coordination, and upgrade delivery.

Ascend's pledge helps to underwrite Ethereum's long-term reliability, a natural complement to their standards-first approach to institutional-grade RWAs. By building with ERC-4656 and focusing on base layer composability, they are unlocking paths for regulated assets to flow through DeFi, expanding economic bandwidth while preserving Ethereum's neutrality. This mission aligns strongly with the Protocol Guild ethos: durable support for durable public infrastructure.

Ascend will continue advancing an institutionally accessible framework for RWAs, bridging traditional finance with Ethereum's settlement assurances. Their pledge participation ensures that part of the value created will flow back to the maintainers of Ethereum, who the entire ecosystem rely on. This strengthening of the core development process creates a positive feedback loop.
